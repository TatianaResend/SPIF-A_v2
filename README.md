# SPIFA-e-v2.0

Base requirements:
- working area of 200 x 200 mm with 100 mm depth.

---------------
## Configuration

The study of possible configurations is demonstrated in issues #1 to #4. After the analysis it is concluded that the best configuration is case 1.1.1..

Configuration case 1.1.1:
- 2 arms in parallel (delta 2)
- Distance between motors: 50 mm
- L1 = 100;
- L2 = 150;
- y _ work area = -130 mm

## Simulation:

Maximum torque analysis:
Torque is maximum at the upper right and upper left points, so the four extreme points were analyzed.
